            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:36279:7"/>ſtation) who have reſorted to Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures and monethly exerciſes (as<note n="(x)" place="margin">Iſa. 60.8.</note> doves fly to their windows) going from ſtrength to ſtrength many miles round about till they appeared before God in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Saints. Such their courſe ſeemed to be a reall &amp; experimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall commentary on the 84 Pſalme.</p>
            <p>True it is, there hath beene ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall oppoſition againſt Lectures in England (I tremble to mention it) through the abſurd unreaſonable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſome ſeeking<note n="(y)" place="margin">2 Theſſ. 3.2.</note> to hinder the free courſe of the Goſpell.

            <p>Thirdly, the reſpective perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of religious family-duties by the people of God in England, crowneth their keeping of the Sabbath, and attendance on Lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures: ſith thereby it is demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, that their<note n="(a)" place="margin">Deut. 6.6, 7.</note> Chriſtian pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion is to purpoſe, turning words into works, and attaining a power of godlineſſe, aſwell as the forme of it.</p>

               <p>PROOF. The Lords Prayer, is not only a rule of prayer, but alſo a forme of praver: As appeareth by comparing together Math. 6.9, &amp;c. and Luk. 11.2.

Our Saviour Chriſt and his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, notwithſtanding their reſpective fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenting the Synagogues on the Sabbath daies; yet after the publick miniſtery was ended, they alſo redeemed the time in pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate unto religious exerciſes. This may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare,
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:36279:67"/>Math. 12.1. &amp; 13.1. compared with Math. 13.36, 37. <hi>Then Ieſus ſent the multitude away, and went into the houſe: and his diſciples came unto him, ſaying, Declare unto us the parable of the tares of the field. He anſwered and ſaid unto them, He that ſoweth the good ſeed, is the ſonne of man, &amp;c.</hi> See alſo Mark. 1.21, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="1">I. REAS. Becauſe the Sabbath day ought to be ſequeſtred wholly from a purſuit of profits and pleaſures of this life, and to be ſpent wholly in holy exerciſes, publickly or privatly, as the Lord hath commanded, Exod. 20.8. <hi>Remember the Sabbath day to keepe it holy; &amp;c.</hi> for here is no exemption nor exception given to any part of the day, that it ſhould not be ſanctified, and kept holy, aſwell as the other parts of the day. See alſo Iſaiah, 58.13, 14.</p>
               <p n="2">II. REAS. Becauſe a performance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious exerciſes in private on the Sabbath day, tendeth much unto a better profiting by the adminiſtration of the publick ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; viz. A preparation in private before the publick ordinances be taken in hand, and prayer, conference, and meditation after the publick ordinances are ended, touching the ſame, conduce much to a good ſucceſſe thereof. This is in part implied in Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah the King his prayer and its ſucceſſe, in the behalfe of the people of the Jews at the
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:36279:68"/>celebration of the Paſſeover, 2 Chron. 30.18, 19, 20.—<q>But Hezekiah prayed for them, ſaying, The good Lord pardon every one; That prepareth his heart to ſeeke God, the Lord God of his fathers, though he be not cleanſed according to the purification of the Sanctuary. And the Lord hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.</q>] See alſo for after-courſe what is recorded, Act. 13.42. <q>Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews, and religious Proſelytes followed Paul &amp; Barnabas, who ſpeaking to them, perſwaded them to continue in the grace of God, &amp;c.</q>
               </p>
               <p>OBSERV. Such as having converſed with God in the religious uſe of his publick ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, on the Sabbath day, in the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, doe goe forth after cares, and riches, and pleaſures of this life, aſſoone as the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies are diſmiſſed, they cannot bring forth fruit unto perfection: as is to be ſeene in the ſtate of that ſort of unfruitfull hearers of the word, who are by our Saviour Chriſt reſembled unto the thorny ground, Luk. 8.14. <q>And that which fell among thornes, are they which when they have heard, goe forth, and are choked with cares, and riches, and pleaſures of this life; and bring no fruit to perfection.</q>
